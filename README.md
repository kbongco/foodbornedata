#Cleaning and Analyzing Food Borne Data

This is my first cleaning and data analysis project. I've used what I've learned from dataquest.io's course on
data cleaning and data analysis and applied it to this dataset that was found on Kaggle and the CDC site. 

I chose this topic because I am a career changer going from the food industry and one of my interests was food microbiology,
so I thought it would be appropriate that I was doing some data cleaning and analysis on this.
